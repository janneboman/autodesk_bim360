# autodesk_bim360  

Useful scripts for performing various things in BIM360 with Autodesk Forge API  
Autodesk's Forge API documentation: https://forge.autodesk.com/developer/documentation  
My goal with this project is to clean up some scripts I made for my own needs and make them available for anyone who happens to need these :)
